# MathIt 🚀

> Math it. Solve it. Own it.

## Transform Math from a Subject into an Action

MathIt is an innovative curriculum builder that connects real-world challenges to mathematical concepts. We're making math a verb - students don't just "learn math," they "math it!"

## 🎯 Mission

Transform mathematics education by:
- Connecting abstract concepts to real-world problems
- Making math an active, empowering experience
- Building confidence through practical application
- Creating a community of educators and learners who "math it"

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-World Challenges**: From compound interest to viral spread modeling
- **Educator Platform**: Create and share custom math activities
- **Student Engagement**: Gamified learning with "Math it!" actions
- **Age-Appropriate Content**: Tailored for students aged 10-17
- **Comprehensive Topics**: 
  - Financial Literacy
  - Probability & Statistics
  - Game Theory
  - Linear Algebra
  - Calculus
  - Data Analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
